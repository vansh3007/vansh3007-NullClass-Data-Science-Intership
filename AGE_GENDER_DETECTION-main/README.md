# Age and Gender Detection with Deep Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **deep learning-based** application that detects a person's **age and gender** from images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a user-friendly UI built with Streamlit**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Pretrained CNN model** for accurate predictions  
- **Image preprocessing** for better input quality  
- **Streamlit UI** for an interactive experience  
- **Visualization** of training and validation performance  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `Age_Sex_Detection.h5/` → Trained deep learning model  
- `app.py` → Streamlit UI for user interaction  
- `age_gender_identification.ipynb` → Model training and evaluation script  
- `requirements.txt` → List of dependencies  

## 🛠 Installation & Usage  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aslin72/AGE_GENDER_DETECTION.git
   cd AGE_GENDER_DETECTION
   ```  
2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. **Run the Streamlit app**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```  

## 📌 Model & Optimization  
This is a **basic model**, and there’s room for **optimization**. You can:  
- Improve **CNN architecture** for better accuracy  
- Use **data augmentation** to enhance dataset quality  
- Fine-tune with **transfer learning**
